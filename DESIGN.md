## 3. Core Services Design

### 3.1 Authentication Service (`auth.py`)
```python
class AuthenticationService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.embedding_service = VoiceEmbeddingService()
        self.anti_spoof_service = AntiSpoofService()
        self.index = None
        self.user_map = {}
```

#### Key Responsibilities:
- User enrollment and verification
- Voice embedding management
- Anti-spoofing checks
- Vector storage management

#### Key Methods:
- `enroll_user(user_id: str, audio_path: str) -> Tuple[bool, str]`
- `verify_user(user_id: str, audio_path: str) -> Tuple[bool, float, str]`
- `get_user_info(user_id: str) -> Optional[Dict]`

### 3.2 Voice Embedding Service (`embedding.py`)
```python
class VoiceEmbeddingService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.device = None
```

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Voice feature extraction
- Embedding generation
- Similarity computation

#### Key Methods:
- `generate_embedding(audio_path: str) -> Tuple[np.ndarray, Optional[str]]`
- `compute_similarity(embedding1: np.ndarray, embedding2: np.ndarray) -> float`

### 3.3 Anti-Spoof Service (`anti_spoof.py`)
```python
class AntiSpoofService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model = None
        self.device = None
```

#### Key Responsibilities:
- Voice liveness detection
- Audio quality analysis
- Spoofing attempt detection

#### Key Methods:
- `check_liveness(audio_path: str) -> Tuple[bool, float, Optional[str]]`
- `analyze_audio_quality(audio_path: str) -> Dict`

## 4. Data Flow

### 4.1 Enrollment Process
1. User submits voice sample through UI
2. API receives and validates the sample
3. Anti-spoof service checks for liveness
4. Voice embedding service generates embedding
5. Authentication service stores embedding
6. Response returned to UI

### 4.2 Verification Process
1. User submits voice sample through UI
2. API receives and validates the sample
3. Anti-spoof service checks for liveness
4. Voice embedding service generates embedding
5. Authentication service compares with stored embedding
6. Response returned to UI

## 5. Security Measures

### 5.1 Anti-Spoofing
- Liveness detection using deep learning
- Audio quality analysis
- Multiple verification checks

### 5.2 Data Protection
- Secure storage of voice embeddings
- No raw audio storage
- FAISS-based vector storage

## 6. Performance Considerations

### 6.1 Scalability
- FAISS for efficient similarity search
- Asynchronous API endpoints
- Efficient vector storage

### 6.2 Accuracy
